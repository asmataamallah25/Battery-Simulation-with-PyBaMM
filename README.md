# Battery Simulation with PyBaMM

This notebook demonstrates how to use the PyBaMM library to simulate a lithium-ion battery and visualize the results. 

## Features

* **Battery Simulation:** Simulates a lithium-ion battery discharge using the Single Particle Model (SPM) in PyBaMM.
* **Visualization:** Uses QuickPlot to create interactive visualizations of battery variables like voltage, current, and concentrations.
* **Easy to Use:** Provides a step-by-step guide for installing PyBaMM, setting up the simulation, and visualizing the results.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* PyBaMM (install using `pip install pybamm`)
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to install PyBaMM, import libraries, run the simulation, and visualize the results.

## Example

The notebook simulates a 1-hour discharge of a lithium-ion battery and visualizes the following variables:

* Terminal voltage
* Current
* Negative particle surface concentration
* Positive particle surface concentration
